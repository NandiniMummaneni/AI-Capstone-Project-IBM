**Geospatial Land Classification Using CNNs and Vision Transformers**

Part of IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate — Capstone Project.

This project demonstrates the **development of deep learning models** for **classifying satellite imagery into different land types** for ex Land. It covers key AI engineering concepts including **data preprocessing, model development, transfer learning, and performance evaluation.**

**🚀 Project Overview:**
The project is divided into several key phases, each highlighting a specific aspect of deep learning development:

**Phase 1: Data Preprocessing and Augmentation**
In this phase, geospatial image datasets were loaded, normalized, and augmented to improve model generalization. Custom data loaders were implemented for efficient memory management, and both generator-based and memory-based approaches were explored.

**Output:** Preprocessed and augmented datasets ready for CNN and Vision Transformer training.

**Phase 2: CNN Model Development**
Convolutional Neural Networks were designed and trained using Keras and PyTorch. Model performance was monitored using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure proper learning and generalization.

**Output:** Trained CNN models with evaluated performance metrics, demonstrating their capability in land classification.

**Phase 3: Vision Transformer Implementation and Transfer Learning**
Pre-trained Vision Transformer models were fine-tuned for the land classification task. Their performance was compared against CNN models to evaluate the effectiveness of transformers in this domain.

**Output:** Fine-tuned Vision Transformer models and comparative analysis with CNNs.

**Phase 4:** Model Evaluation and Reporting
